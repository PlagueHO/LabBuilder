Summary
=======
This module will build a multiple machine Hyper-V Lab environment from an XML configuration file and other optional installation scripts.


Introduction
============
While studying for some of my Microsoft certifications I had a need to quickly and easily spin up various Hyper-V Lab environments so that I could experiment with and learn the technologies involved.

Originally I performed this process manually, creating Hyper-V VM's and environments to suit. But as the complexity of the Lab environment increased (e.g. take multi-tier PKIs) manually building these Labs became unmanageable. Also, if I wanted to repeat a particular process multiple times I would have to either snapshot multiple VMs or manually back them all up. This quickly became unsupportable as snapshots slows VMs down and constant backups of large Hyper-V environments was slow and also limited by space. This gave me a basic set of requirements for this module.

So as a solution to these problems I decided that I wanted a declarative approach to automating the process of building a Lab environment.

This had the following advantages:
+ Building a new Lab with multiple VMs was automated.
+ Creation of the actual Lab VMs could be done without supervision.
+ Once a basic Lab was created more complex Lab environments could be created by cloning the original XML configuration and tailoring it.
+ Configuration files could be distributed easily.
+ Because the post setup configuration of the Lab VM machines was performed via DSC this gave me an opportunity to work with DSC to a greater depth.
+ The configuration files could be created by people without knowledge of PowerShell or DSC.
+ UI based applications could be easily created to generate the configuration XML.


Goals
=====
The general goals of this module are:
+ **One-Click Create**: Enable "one-click" creation of a Hyper-V Lab environment.
+ **Easy Configuration**: Enable non-developers to easily define Lab environments.
+ **Multiple Labs**: Support multiple Lab environments on the same Hyper-V host.
+ **Stretched Labs**: Allow a Lab environment to span or be installed on a remote Hyper-V host.
+ **Lab Isolation**: Ensure that multiple Lab environments are completely isolated from each other.
+ **Minimal Disk Usage**: Minimize Lab footprint by utilizing differencing disks where possible.
+ **Configuration Flexibility**: Allow GUI based tools to be easily created to create Lab configurations.
+ **Extensible**: Enable new Lab VM machine types to be configured by supplying different DSC library resources.


Basic Usage Guide
=================
The use of this module is fairly simple from a process standpoint with the bulk of the work creating a Lab going into the creation of the configuration XML that defines it. But if there is a Lab configuration already available that fits your needs then there is almost nothing to do.

A Lab consists of the following items:
- A configuration XML file that defines the Virtual Machines, Switches, the DSC config files and anything else related to how the Lab is set up.
- Copies of the Windows Operating System Images used in the Lab which are: 
   - Either VHDs containing Syspreped Windows images.
   - Or Windows Installation media ISO files (these will be automatically converted to VHDs for you during Lab creation).
- Any DSC configuration files that are used to configure the Lab VMs after the OS initial start up has completed.

There are a library of DSC configuration files for various machine types already defined and available for you to use in the **DSCLibrary** folder.

Once these files are available the process of setting up the Lab is simple.
 1. Make a folder where all your Lab files will go (e.g. VMs, VHDs, ISOs, scripts) - e.g. c:\MyLab
 2. Copy your the Lab Configuration XML file into that folder (try one of the sample configurations in the **Samples** folder).
 3. Edit the Lab Configuration XML file and customize the Settings to suit (specifically the LabPath setting). 
 4. Make a folder in your Lab folder for your Windows ISO files called **isofiles** - e.g. c:\MyLab\ISOFiles
 5. Copy any ISO files into this folder that your lab will use.
 6. Make a folder in your Lab folder for your VHD boot templates (converted from the ISO files) **vhdfiles** - e.g. c:\MyLab\VHDFiles
 7. Run the following commands in an Administrative PowerShell window:
```powershell
Import-Module LabBuilder
Install-Lab -ConfigPath 'c:\MyLab\Configuration.xml'
```

This will create a new Lab using the c:\MyLab\Configuration.xml file.


ISO Files
=========
During the Install process of a Lab, if the template VHD files to use as boot disks for your VMs, LabBuilder will attempt to convert the required ISO files into VHD boot disks for you.
This will only occur if the ISO files required to build a specific VHD file are found in the ISO folder specified by the Lab.

By default LabBuilder will look in the **isofiles** subfolder of your Lab folder for any ISO files it needs.
You can change the folder that a Lab looks in for the ISO files by changing/setting the _isopath_ attribute of the _<templatevhds>_ node in the configuration
If it can't find an ISO file it needs, you will be notified of an official download location for trial or preview editions of the ISO files (as long as the LabBuilder configuration you're using contains the download URLs).

Some common ISO download locations:  
 - Windows Server 2012 R2: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2012-r2
 - Windows 10 Enterprise: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise
 - Windows Server 2016 TP4: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-technical-preview

Multiple VHD templates may use the same ISO file in a Lab.
For example, if multiple editions of an Operating system are used in the same lab.

Once an ISO has been converted to an VHD, it will be stored in the VHDFiles folder in your lab folder.
However, if you are using multiple Labs on the same machine you might want to share these VHD files between mutlpile Lab projects to save having to build and store copies for each Lab.
In that case, you can set the _vhdpath_ attribute of the _<templatevhds>_ node in the configuration to a different relative or absolute path.

The conversion process for a single ISO to VHD can take 10-20 minutes depending on your machine.
For this reason multiple Labs can be configured to use the same path to store these VHDs by changing the _vhdpath_ attribute of the _<templatevhds>_ node in the configuration. 


Requirements
============
To use this Module you will require on your Lab Host:
 1. Operating Systems supported:
    - Windows Server 2012
    - Windows Server 2012 R2
    - Windows Server 2016 TP4
    - Windows 8.0
    - Windows 8.1
    - Windows 10
 2. Hyper-V available (which requires intel-VT CPU support).
 3. To use labs that contain Nested Hyper-V hosts only Windows 10 built 10586 or later and Windows Server 2016 TP3 or later are supported.
 4. Copies of the Windows installation media for any Operating Systems that will be used in your Labs.
    * Note: Many Lab configuration files can contain a URL where the relevant trial media can be downloaded from.

Start-Lab
---------
### SYNOPSIS
Starts an existing Lab.

### DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet will start all the Hyper-V virtual machines definied in a Lab
configuration.

It will use the Bootorder attribute (if defined) for any VMs to determine
the order they should be booted in. If a Bootorder is not specified for a
machine, it will be booted after all machines with a defined boot order.

The lower the Bootorder value for a machine the earlier it will be started
in the start process.

Machines will be booted in series, with each machine starting once the
previous machine has completed startup and has a management IP address.

If a Virtual Machine in the Lab is already running, it will be ignored
and the next machine in series will be started.

If more than one Virtual Machine shares the same Bootorder value, then
these machines will be booted in parallel, with the boot process only
continuing onto the next Bootorder when all these machines are booted.

If a Virtual Machine specified in the configuration is not found an
exception will be thrown.

If a Virtual Machine takes longer than the StartupTimeout then an exception
will be thown but the Start process will continue.

If a Bootorder of 0 is specifed then the Virtual Machine will not be booted at
all. This is useful for things like Root CA VMs that only need to started when
the Lab is created.

### PARAMETER ConfigPath
The path to the LabBuilder configuration XML file.

### PARAMETER LabPath
The optional path to install the Lab to - overrides the LabPath setting in the
configuration file.

### PARAMETER Lab

Defaults to 90 seconds.

### EXAMPLE
```powershell
Start-Lab -ConfigPath c:\mylab\config.xml
```
Start the lab defined in the c:\mylab\config.xml LabBuilder configuration file.

### EXAMPLE
```powershell
Get-Lab -ConfigPath c:\mylab\config.xml | Start-Lab
```
Start the lab defined in the c:\mylab\config.xml LabBuilder configuration file.

### OUTPUTS
None
    

Stop-Lab
--------
### SYNOPSIS
Stop an existing Lab.

### DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet will stop all the Hyper-V virtual machines definied in a Lab
configuration.

It will use the Bootorder attribute (if defined) for any VMs to determine
the order they should be shutdown in. If a Bootorder is not specified for a
machine, it will be shutdown before all machines with a defined boot order.

The higher the Bootorder value for a machine the earlier it will be shutdown
in the stop process.

The Virtual Machines will be shutdown in REVERSE Bootorder.

Machines will be shutdown in series, with each machine shutting down once the
previous machine has completed shutdown.

If a Virtual Machine in the Lab is already shutdown, it will be ignored
and the next machine in series will be shutdown.

If more than one Virtual Machine shares the same Bootorder value, then
these machines will be shutdown in parallel, with the shutdown process only
continuing onto the next Bootorder when all these machines are shutdown.

If a Virtual Machine specified in the configuration is not found an
exception will be thrown.

If a Virtual Machine takes longer than the ShutdownTimeout then an exception
will be thown but the Stop process will continue.

### PARAMETER ConfigPath
The path to the LabBuilder configuration XML file.

### PARAMETER LabPath
The optional path to install the Lab to - overrides the LabPath setting in the
configuration file.
